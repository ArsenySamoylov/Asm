Here you can find source code for 2 applications.

1st: app for Dos that asks user to enter password and either give or not access
     This app has 2 vulnerabilities: 
          -) if you press ESC for some time, programm will grant you success
          -) if al = 1, before the int 9, programm will grand you access
